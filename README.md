# <a name="title"></a> chef-logstash [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lusis/chef-logstash.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lusis/chef-logstash)

Description
===========

This is the semi-official 'all-in-one' Logstash cookbook.

This cookbook is in transition from being a regular cookbook to following the Library Cookbook pattern.
While you can still use the `agent` and `server` recipes,  the power of this cookbook now comes from the
`LWRPs`.

If you are using logstash < 1.2 you might want to use the 0.6.x branch.
If you are using logstash < 1.4 you might want to use the 0.7.x branch.

Requirements
============

All of the requirements are explicitly defined in the recipes. Every
effort has been made to utilize Opscode's cookbooks.

However if you wish to use an external ElasticSearch cluster, you will
need to install that yourself and change the relevant attributes for
discovery. The same applies to integration with Graphite.

This cookbook has been tested together with the following cookbooks,
see the Berksfile for more details

* [Heavywater Graphite Cookbook](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/graphite)   - This is the one I use
* [Karmi's ElasticSearch Cookbook](https://github.com/elasticsearch/cookbook-elasticsearch)
* [RiotGames RBENV cookbook](https://github.com/RiotGames/rbenv-cookbook)
* [@lusis Kibana cookbook](https://github.com/lusis/chef-kibana)

Attributes
==========

## Default

see [attributes/default.rb](attributes/default.rb)

## Beaver (alternative to Logstash Agent)

_This will be depreciated soon in favor of an external library cookbook._

* `node['logstash']['beaver']['repo']` - URL or repository to install
  beaver from (using pip).
* `node['logstash']['beaver']['server_role']` - The role of the node
  behaving as a Logstash `server`/`indexer`.
* `node['logstash']['beaver']['server_ipaddress']` - Server IP address
  to use (needed when not using server_role).
* `node['logstash']['beaver']['inputs']` - Array of input plugins
  configuration (Supported: file).
  For example:
  
        override['logstash']['beaver']['inputs'] =  [
          { :file =>  
            {
              :path => ["/var/log/nginx/*log"], 
              :type => "nginx", 
              :tags => ["logstash","nginx"]
            }
          },
          { :file =>  
            {
              :path => ["/var/log/syslog"], 
              :type => "syslog", 
              :tags => ["logstash","syslog"] 
            }
          }
        ]    
    
* `node['logstash']['beaver']['outputs']` - Array of output plugins
  configuration (Supported: amq, redis, stdout, zeromq).
  For example:

        override['logstash']['beaver']['outputs'] = [ 
          { 
            :amqp => { 
              :port => "5672",
              :exchange => "rawlogs",
              :name => "rawlogs_consumer"
            } 
          } 
        ]
  This example sets up the amqp output and uses the recipe defaults for the host value

## Source

* `node['logstash']['source']['repo']` - The git repo to use for the
  source code of Logstash
* `node['logstash']['source']['sha']` - The sha/branch/tag of the repo
  you wish to clone. Uses `node['logstash']['server']['version']` by
  default.
* `node['logstash']['source']['java_home']` - your `JAVA_HOME`
  location. Needed explicity for `ant` when building JRuby

## Index Cleaner

* `node['logstash']['index_cleaner']['days_to_keep']` - Integer number
  of days from today of Logstash index to keep.
* `node['logstash']['index_cleaner']['cron']['minute']` - Minute to run
  the index_cleaner cron job
* `node['logstash']['index_cleaner']['cron']['hour']` - Hour to run the
  index_cleaner cron job
* `node['logstash']['index_cleaner']['cron']['log_file']` - Path to direct
  the index_cleaner cron job's stdout and stderr

Lightweight Resource Providers
===================

These now do all the heavy lifting.

## logstash_instance

This will install a logstash instance.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes.

see [resources/instance.rb](resources/instance.rb)

## logstash_service

This will create system init scripts for managing logstash instance.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes.

see [resources/service.rb](resources/service.rb)

_experimental support for pleaserun has been added.   Only `native` for `Ubuntu 12.04` has been thoroughly tested._

## logstash_config

This will create logstash config files.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes.

see [resources/config.rb](resources/config.rb)

## logstash_pattern

This will install custom grok patterns for logstash.   It will take defaults from attributes for most attributes:

see [resources/pattern.rb](resources/pattern.rb)

## logstash_plugns

This will install the logstash community plugins:

see [resources/plugins.rb](resources/plugins.rb)

## attribute precidence in logstash LWRPs

We've done our best to make this intuitive and easy to use.

1. the value directly in the resource call.
2. the value from the hash node['logstash']['instance'][name]
3. the value from the hash node['logstash']['instance']['default']

## logstash_beaver_input

Setup a Beaver input: 

```
  logstash_beaver_input "nginx" do
    path ["/var/log/nginx/*"]
    type "nginx"
    tags %w{nginx access}
    multiline_regex_before "^\s+"
  end
```

This creates a file called /opt/logstash/beaver/etc/conf.d/nginx.

Searching
======

There is a search helper library `libraries/search.rb` which will help you search for values such as `elasticsearch_ip`.  see the `server` recipe for an example of its usage.


Testing
=======

## Vagrant

```
vagrant up precise64
```

## Rubocop, FoodCritic, Rspec, Test-Kitchen

```
bundle exec rake
```

Contributing
========

Any and all contributions are welcome.   We do ask that you test your contributions with the testing framework before you send a PR.

Documentation contributions will earn you lots of hugs and kisses.

Usage
=====

A proper readme is forthcoming but in the interim....

These two recipes show how to install and configure logstash instances via the provided `LWRPs`

* [recipe/server.rb](recipe/server.rb) - This would be your indexer node
* [recipe/agent.rb](recipe/agent.rb) - This would be a local host's agent for collection


Every attempt (and I mean this) was made to ensure that the following
objectives were met:

* Any agent install can talk to a server install
* Kibana web interface can talk to the server install
* Each component works OOB and with each other
* Utilize official opscode cookbooks where possible

This setup makes HEAVY use of roles. Additionally, ALL paths have been
made into attributes. Everything I could think of that would need to
be customized has been made an attribute.

## Defaults

By default, the recipes look for the following roles (defined as
attributes so they can be overridden):

* `graphite_server` - `node['logstash']['graphite_role']`
* `elasticsearch_server` - `node['logstash']['elasticsearch_role']`
* `logstash_server` -
  `node['logstash']['kibana']['elasticsearch_role']` and
  `node['logstash']['agent']['server_role']`

The reason for giving `kibana` its own role assignment is to allow you
to point to existing ES clusters/logstash installs.

The reason for giving `agent` its own role assignment is to allow the
`server` and `agent` recipes to work together.

Yes, if you have a graphite installation with a role of
`graphite_server`, logstash will send stats of events received to
`logstash.events`.

## Agent and Server configuration

The template to use for configuration is made an attribute as well.
This allows you to define your OWN logstash configuration file without
mucking with the default templates.

The `server` will, by default, enable the embedded ES server. This can
be overriden as well.

See the `server` and `agent` attributes for more details.

## Source vs. Jar install methods

Both `agent` and `server` support an attribute for how to install. By
default this is set to `jar` to use the 1.1.1preview as it is required
to use elasticsearch 0.19.4. The current release is defined in
attributes if you choose to go the `source` route.

## Out of the box behaviour

Here are some basic steps

* Create a role called `logstash_server` and assign it the following
  recipes: `logstash::server`
* Assign the role to a new server
* Assign the `logstash::agent` recipe to another server

If there is a system found with the `logstash_server` role, the agent
will automatically configure itself to send logs to it over tcp port
5959. This is, not coincidently, the port used by the chef logstash
handler.

If there is NOT a system with the `logstash_server` role, the agent
will use a null output. The default input is to read files from
`/var/log/*.log` excluding and gzipped files.

If you point your browser to the `logstash_server` system's ip
address, you should get the kibana web interface.

Do something to generate a new line in any of the files in the agent's
watch path (I like to SSH to the host), and the events will start
showing up in kibana. You might have to issue a fresh empty search.

The `pyshipper` recipe will work as well but it is NOT wired up to
anything yet.

## config templates

If you want to use chef templates to drive your configs you'll want to set the following:

* example using `agent`, `server` works the same way.
* The actual template file for the following would resolve to `templates/default/apache.conf.erb` and be installed to `/opt/logstash/agent/etc/conf.d/apache.conf`
* Each template has a hash named for it to inject variables in `node['logstash']['agent']['config_templates_variables']`


```
node['logstash']['agent']['config_file'] = "" # disable data drive templates ( can be left enabled if want both )
node['logstash']['agent']['config_templates'] = ["apache"]
node['logstash']['agent']['config_templates_cookbook'] = 'logstash'
node['logstash']['agent']['config_templates_variables'] = { apache: { type: 'apache' } }
```




## Letting data drive your templates

*DEPRECIATED!*

While this may work ...   it is no longer being actively supported by the maintainers of this cookbook.
We will accept `PRs`.

The current templates for the agent and server are written so that you
can provide ruby hashes in your roles that map to inputs, filters, and
outputs. Here is a role for logstash_server.

There are two formats for the hashes for filters and outputs that you should be aware of ...   

### Legacy

This is for logstash < 1.2.0 and uses the old pattern of setting 'type' and 'tags' in the plugin to determine if it should be run.

```
filters: [
  grok: {
  type: "syslog"
    match: [
      "message",
      "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{IPORHOST:host} (?:%{PROG:program}(?:\[%{POSINT:pid}\])?: )?%{GREEDYDATA:message}"
    ]
  },
  date: {
  type: "syslog"
    match: [ 
      "timestamp",
      "MMM  d HH:mm:ss",
      "MMM dd HH:mm:ss",
      "ISO8601"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Conditional

This is for logstash >= 1.2.0 and uses the new pattern of conditioansl `if 'type' == "foo" {}`

Note:  the condition applies to all plugins in the block hash in the same object.

```
filters: [
  { 
    condition: 'if [type] == "syslog"',
    block: {    
      grok: {
        match: [
          "message",
          "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{IPORHOST:host} (?:%{PROG:program}(?:\[%{POSINT:pid}\])?: )?%{GREEDYDATA:message}"
        ]
      },
      date: {
        match: [ 
          "timestamp",
          "MMM  d HH:mm:ss",
          "MMM dd HH:mm:ss",
          "ISO8601"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Examples

These examples show the legacy format and need to be updated for logstash >= 1.2.0

    name "logstash_server"
    description "Attributes and run_lists specific to FAO's logstash instance"
    default_attributes(
      :logstash => {
        :server => {
          :enable_embedded_es => false,
          :inputs => [
            :rabbitmq => {
              :type => "all",
              :host => "<IP OF RABBIT SERVER>",
              :exchange => "rawlogs"
            }
          ],
          :filters => [
            :grok => {
              :type => "haproxy",
              :pattern => "%{HAPROXYHTTP}",
              :patterns_dir => '/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/'
            }
          ],
          :outputs => [
            :file => {
              :type => 'haproxy',
              :path => '/opt/logstash/server/haproxy_logs/%{request_header_host}.log',
              :message_format => '%{client_ip} - - [%{accept_date}] "%{http_request}" %{http_status_code} ....'
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    )
    run_list(
      "role[elasticsearch_server]",
      "recipe[logstash::server]"
    )


It will produce the following logstash.conf file

    input {

      amqp {
        exchange => 'rawlogs'
        host => '<IP OF RABBIT SERVER>'
        name => 'rawlogs_consumer'
        type => 'all'
      }
    }

    filter {

      grok {
        pattern => '%{HAPROXYHTTP}'
        patterns_dir => '/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/'
        type => 'haproxy'
      }
    }

    output {
      stdout { debug => true debug_format => "json" }
      elasticsearch { host => "127.0.0.1" cluster => "logstash" }

      file {
        message_format => '%{client_ip} - - [%{accept_date}] "%{http_request}" %{http_status_code} ....'
        path => '/opt/logstash/server/haproxy_logs/%{request_header_host}.log'
        type => 'haproxy'
      }
    }

Here is an example using multiple filters

    default_attributes(
      :logstash => {
        :server => {
          :filters => [
            { :grep => {
                :type => 'tomcat',
                :match => { '@message' => '([Ee]xception|Failure:|Error:)' },
                :add_tag => 'exception',
                :drop => false
            } },
            { :grep => {
                :type => 'tomcat',
                :match => { '@message' => 'Unloading class ' },
                :add_tag => 'unloading-class',
                :drop => false
            } },
            { :multiline => {
                :type => 'tomcat',
                :pattern => '^\s',
                :what => 'previous'
            } }
          ]
        }
      }
    )

It will produce the following logstash.conf file

    filter {

      grep {
        add_tag => 'exception'
        drop => false
        match => ['@message', '([Ee]xception|Failure:|Error:)']
        type => 'tomcat'
      }

      grep {
        add_tag => 'unloading-class'
        drop => false
        match => ["@message", "Unloading class "]
        type => 'tomcat'
      }

      multiline {
        patterns_dir => '/opt/logstash/patterns'
        pattern => '^\s'
        type => 'tomcat'
        what => 'previous'
      }

    }

## Adding grok patterns

Grok pattern files can be generated using attributes as follows

    default_attributes(
      :logstash => {
        :patterns => {
          :apache => {
            :HTTP_ERROR_DATE => '%{DAY} %{MONTH} %{MONTHDAY} %{TIME} %{YEAR}',
            :APACHE_LOG_LEVEL => '[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+',
            :ERRORAPACHELOG => '^\[%{HTTP_ERROR_DATE:timestamp}\] \[%{APACHE_LOG_LEVEL:level}\](?: \[client %{IPORHOST:clientip}\])?',
          },
          :mywebapp => {
            :MYWEBAPP_LOG => '\[mywebapp\]',
          },
        },
        [...]
      }
    )

This will generate the following files:

`/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/apache`

    APACHE_LOG_LEVEL [A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+
    ERRORAPACHELOG ^\[%{HTTP_ERROR_DATE:timestamp}\] \[%{APACHE_LOG_LEVEL:level}\](?: \[client %{IPORHOST:clientip}\])?
    HTTP_ERROR_DATE %{DAY} %{MONTH} %{MONTHDAY} %{TIME} %{YEAR}

`/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/mywebapp`

    MYWEBAPP_LOG \[mywebapp\]

This patterns will be included by default in the grok and multiline
filters.


# Vagrant

## Requirements
* Vagrant 1.2.1+
* Vagrant Berkshelf Plugin `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`
* Vagrant Omnibus Plugin   `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`

Uses the Box Name to determine the run list ( based on whether its Debian or RHEL based ).

See chef_json and chef_run_list variables to change recipe behavior.

## Usage:

Run Logstash on Ubuntu Lucid   : `vagrant up lucid32` or `vagrant up lucid64`

Run Logstash on Centos 6 32bit : `vagrant up centos6_32`

Logstash will listen for syslog messages on tcp/5140
