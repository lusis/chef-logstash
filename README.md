# <a name="title"></a> chef-logstash [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lusis/chef-logstash.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lusis/chef-logstash)

Description
===========

This is the semi-official 'all-in-one' Logstash cookbook.

Requirements
============

All of the requirements are explicitly defined in the recipes. Every
effort has been made to utilize Opscode's cookbooks.

However if you wish to use an external ElasticSearch cluster, you will
need to install that yourself and change the relevant attributes for
discovery. The same applies to integration with Graphite.

This cookbook has been tested together with the following cookbooks,
see the Berksfile for more details

* [Heavywater Graphite Cookbook](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/graphite)   - This is the one I use
* [Karmi's ElasticSearch Cookbook](https://github.com/elasticsearch/cookbook-elasticsearch)

Kibana has been removed from this cookbook. This is for several reasons:

- Kibana is a fast moving target
- It violates SRP
- Kibana is being integrated into the logstash jar as the default UI

Usage
=====

A proper readme is forthcoming but in the interim....

There are 3 recipes you need to concern yourself with:

* server - This would be your indexer node
* agent - This would be a local host's agent for collection
* kibana - This is the web interface

Every attempt (and I mean this) was made to ensure that the following
objectives were met:

* Any agent install can talk to a server install
* Kibana web interface can talk to the server install
* Each component works OOB and with each other
* Utilize official opscode cookbooks where possible

This setup makes HEAVY use of roles. Additionally, ALL paths have been
made into attributes. Everything I could think of that would need to
be customized has been made an attribute.

## Defaults

By default, the recipes look for the following roles (defined as
attributes so they can be overridden):

* `graphite_server` - `node['logstash']['graphite_role']`
* `elasticsearch_server` - `node['logstash']['elasticsearch_role']`
* `logstash_server` -
  `node['logstash']['kibana']['elasticsearch_role']` and
  `node['logstash']['agent']['server_role']`

The reason for giving `kibana` its own role assignment is to allow you
to point to existing ES clusters/logstash installs.

The reason for giving `agent` its own role assignment is to allow the
`server` and `agent` recipes to work together.

Yes, if you have a graphite installation with a role of
`graphite_server`, logstash will send stats of events received to
`logstash.events`.

## Agent and Server configuration

The template to use for configuration is made an attribute as well.
This allows you to define your OWN logstash configuration file without
mucking with the default templates.

The `server` will, by default, enable the embedded ES server. This can
be overriden as well.

See the `server` and `agent` attributes for more details.

## Source vs. Jar install methods

Both `agent` and `server` support an attribute for how to install. By
default this is set to `jar` to use the 1.1.1preview as it is required
to use elasticsearch 0.19.4. The current release is defined in
attributes if you choose to go the `source` route.

## Out of the box behaviour

Here are some basic steps

* Create a role called `logstash_server` and assign it the following
  recipes: `logstash::server` and `logstash::kibana`
* Assign the role to a new server
* Assign the `logstash::agent` recipe to another server

If there is a system found with the `logstash_server` role, the agent
will automatically configure itself to send logs to it over tcp port
5959. This is, not coincidently, the port used by the chef logstash
handler.

If there is NOT a system with the `logstash_server` role, the agent
will use a null output. The default input is to read files from
`/var/log/*.log` excluding and gzipped files.

If you point your browser to the `logstash_server` system's ip
address, you should get the kibana web interface.

Do something to generate a new line in any of the files in the agent's
watch path (I like to SSH to the host), and the events will start
showing up in kibana. You might have to issue a fresh empty search.

The `pyshipper` recipe will work as well but it is NOT wired up to
anything yet.

## Letting data drive your templates

The current templates for the agent and server are written so that you
can provide ruby hashes in your roles that map to inputs, filters, and
outputs. Here is a role for logstash_server

    name "logstash_server"
    description "Attributes and run_lists specific to FAO's logstash instance"
    default_attributes(
      :logstash => {
        :server => {
          :enable_embedded_es => false,
          :inputs => [
            :amqp => {
              :type => "all",
              :host => "127.0.0.1",
              :exchange => "rawlogs",
              :name => "rawlogs_consumer"
            }
          ],
          :filters => [
            :grok => {
              :type => "haproxy",
              :pattern => "%{HAPROXYHTTP}",
              :patterns_dir => '/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/'
            }
          ],
          :outputs => [
            :file => {
              :type => 'haproxy',
              :path => '/opt/logstash/server/haproxy_logs/%{request_header_host}.log',
              :message_format => '%{client_ip} - - [%{accept_date}] "%{http_request}" %{http_status_code} ....'
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    )
    run_list(
      "role[elasticsearch_server]",
      "recipe[logstash::server]",
      "recipe[php::module_curl]",
      "recipe[logstash::kibana]"
    )


It will produce the following logstash.conf file

    input {

      amqp {
        exchange => 'rawlogs'
        host => '127.0.0.1'
        name => 'rawlogs_consumer'
        type => 'all'
      }
    }

    filter {

      grok {
        pattern => '%{HAPROXYHTTP}'
        patterns_dir => '/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/'
        type => 'haproxy'
      }
    }

    output {
      stdout { debug => true debug_format => "json" }
      elasticsearch { host => "127.0.0.1" cluster => "logstash" }

      file {
        message_format => '%{client_ip} - - [%{accept_date}] "%{http_request}" %{http_status_code} ....'
        path => '/opt/logstash/server/haproxy_logs/%{request_header_host}.log'
        type => 'haproxy'
      }
    }

Here is an example using multiple filters

    default_attributes(
      :logstash => {
        :server => {
          :filters => [
            { :grep => {
                :type => 'tomcat',
                :match => { '@message' => '([Ee]xception|Failure:|Error:)' },
                :add_tag => 'exception',
                :drop => false
            } },
            { :grep => {
                :type => 'tomcat',
                :match => { '@message' => 'Unloading class ' },
                :add_tag => 'unloading-class',
                :drop => false
            } },
            { :multiline => {
                :type => 'tomcat',
                :pattern => '^\s',
                :what => 'previous'
            } }
          ]
        }
      }
    )

It will produce the following logstash.conf file

    filter {

      grep {
        add_tag => 'exception'
        drop => false
        match => ['@message', '([Ee]xception|Failure:|Error:)']
        type => 'tomcat'
      }

      grep {
        add_tag => 'unloading-class'
        drop => false
        match => ["@message", "Unloading class "]
        type => 'tomcat'
      }

      multiline {
        patterns_dir => '/opt/logstash/patterns'
        pattern => '^\s'
        type => 'tomcat'
        what => 'previous'
      }

    }

## Adding grok patterns

Grok pattern files can be generated using attributes as follows

    default_attributes(
      :logstash => {
        :patterns => {
          :apache => {
            :HTTP_ERROR_DATE => '%{DAY} %{MONTH} %{MONTHDAY} %{TIME} %{YEAR}',
            :APACHE_LOG_LEVEL => '[A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+',
            :ERRORAPACHELOG => '^\[%{HTTP_ERROR_DATE:timestamp}\] \[%{APACHE_LOG_LEVEL:level}\](?: \[client %{IPORHOST:clientip}\])?',
          },
          :mywebapp => {
            :MYWEBAPP_LOG => '\[mywebapp\]',
          },
        },
        [...]
      }
    )

This will generate the following files:

`/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/apache`

    APACHE_LOG_LEVEL [A-Za-z][A-Za-z]+
    ERRORAPACHELOG ^\[%{HTTP_ERROR_DATE:timestamp}\] \[%{APACHE_LOG_LEVEL:level}\](?: \[client %{IPORHOST:clientip}\])?
    HTTP_ERROR_DATE %{DAY} %{MONTH} %{MONTHDAY} %{TIME} %{YEAR}

`/opt/logstash/server/etc/patterns/mywebapp`

    MYWEBAPP_LOG \[mywebapp\]

This patterns will be included by default in the grok and multiline
filters.
