# this recipe lets output haproxy logs to file as if they were apache
# virtual logs, in order to interface with legacy traffic measuring
# applications like AWstats
# Also requires changes to your haproxy configuration
# and a file output on your logstash_server
# I have no idea if it meets anyone's needs other than my own
# only for those crazy enough to replace apache or Nginx as their
# main front-end server - Bryan W. Berry 28 June 2012
